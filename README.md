# rise of the karens
## A simple game I made. Code's a mess, controls suck, and the gameplay isn't great.


The game goes as follows: Give the Karen's their desired item before the timer underneath them runs out. If it run out, you loose part of your rating in the top corner. If you give them the correct item, it gives you more rating.

The game has support for the **Gamejolt API** as that is where the game was originally published.

To use the **Gamejolt API** you'll need to grab your **Game ID** and **Private Key** and head over to the **Plugins** folder in **Assets**, from there go into the **Gamejolt API** folder and open up the file named **GJAPISettings** and place in your **Game ID** and **Private KEY**. There may be other settings to change in the code, but I'm not sure where those are as it's been quite a while since I programmed all of that in... (Leaderboards and trophies)
